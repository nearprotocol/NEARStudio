The contract allows you to launch a new token on top of the NEAR blockchain which users can interact with as if it were any other token -- checking balances, transferring, etc.\n\n[AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) compiles strictly typed TypeScript to WebAssembly using Binaryen. See the [AssemblyScript wiki](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/wiki) for further instructions and documentation.",
